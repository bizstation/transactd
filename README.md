Introduction
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Transactd consists of the server side plugin and the client side modules.
The server side plugin is called "Transactd Plugin" and the client side module
is called "Transactd clients".



Preparation of Transactd Plugin binary
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Check the version of your MySQL/MariaDB and download suitable Transactd Plugin
binary. If you don't know what is version, start MySQL Command Line client and
 run following command:
```
mysql>show variables like 'version';
+---------------+--------+
| Variable_name | Value  |
+---------------+--------+
| version       | 5.6.14 |
+---------------+--------+
```
The names of file to download are formed under following rules:

  * Windows - transactd-[platform]-2.0.0_[mysql-version].zip
  * Linux - transactd-linux-x86_64-2.0.0_[mysql-version].tar.gz

[platform] is win32 or win64, [mysql-version] is mysql-5.x.x or mariadb-5.5.x.
For example, the URL for Linux-x86_64bit mysql-5.6.14 is as follows:

http://www.bizstation.jp/al/transactd/download/transactd-2.0.0/transactd-linux-x86_64-2.0.0_mysql-5.6.14.tar.gz

You also can download source code archive and build from it.
In this case, the source code of MySQL/MariaDB is also required.

See BUILD_WIN-{lang}.md or BUILD_UNIX-{lang}.md in the source code archive
for how to build.



Installing Transactd Plugin
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Transactd Plugin can be installed by copying file, without adding any change to
the binary of MySQL/MariaDB.
You don't have to stop MySQL/MariaDB to install the plugin. It requires
administrator authority.

### Installing on Windows
1. Open the zip file downloaded in Explorer. Check if transactd.dll is exists.

2. Copy transactd.dll to `[MySQL|MariaDB installed directory]/lib/plugin`.
   If you don't know where is [MySQL|MariaDB installed directory], start MySQL
   Command Line client and run following command:
```
mysql>show variables like 'plugin%';
+---------------+----------------------------------------------------+
| Variable_name | Value                                              |
+---------------+----------------------------------------------------+
| plugin_dir    | C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.6\lib\Plugin |
+---------------+----------------------------------------------------+
```

3. Start MySQL Command Line client and run following command:
```
mysql>INSTALL PLUGIN transactd SONAME 'transactd.dll';
```
Installation of Transactd Plugin is finished now.


### Installing on Linux

```
shell>cd [TargetFolder]
```

2. Extract the tar.gz file and move into it.
```
shell>tar zxf transactd-linux-x86_64-2.0.0_mysql-5.6.14.tar.gz
shell>cd transactd-linux-x86_64-2.0.0_mysql-5.6.14
```

3. Copy libtransactd.so to `[MySQL|MariaDB installed directory]/lib/plugin`.
   If you don't know where is [MySQL|MariaDB installed directory], start MySQL
   Command Line client and run following command:
```
mysql>show variables like 'plugin%';
+---------------+-----------------------------+
| Variable_name | Value                       |
+---------------+-----------------------------+
| plugin_dir    | /usr/local/mysql/lib/plugin |
+---------------+-----------------------------+
mysql>exit
shell>cp libtransactd.so /usr/local/mysql/lib/plugin/
```

4. Start mysql client and run following command:
```
mysql>INSTALL PLUGIN transactd SONAME 'libtransactd.so';
```
Installation of Transactd Plugin is finished now.



Preparation of Transactd client binaries
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Transactd clients are required to access data through Transactd Plugin.
Download the Transactd client binaries for your platform.
The names of file to download are formed under following rules:

  * Windows - transactd-client-[platform]_with_sdk-2.0.0.zip
  * Linux -  transactd-client-linux-x86_64_with_sdk-2.0.0.tar.gz

[platform] is win32 or win64.
For example, the URL for Linux-x86_64bit is as follows:

http://www.bizstation.jp/al/transactd/download/transactd-client/transactd-client-linux-x86_64_with_sdk-2.0.0.tar.gz



Installing Transactd clients
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Setting host permission to access Transactd
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To access data through Transactd, register root@[host] to user table of MySQL.

* `root@127.0.0.1` allows access from a local machine.
* `root@192.168.0.3` allows access from host 192.168.0.3.
* `root@192.168.0.0/255.255.255.0` allows access from host 192.168.0.x.

Start MySQL Command Line client and run following commands to register hosts.
```
mysql>CREATE USER root@'192.168.0.0/255.255.255.0';
```
This operation allow root user to access database. If the root password is not set,
you MUST SET IT.

### Setup root password on Windows
Open command prompt and run following command:
```
shell>"C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.6\bin\mysqladmin" -u root password 'xxxxx'
```
(Replace xxxxx to your password.)

### Setup root password on Linux
```
shell>/usr/local/mysql/bin/mysqladmin -u root password 'xxxxx'
```
(Replace xxxxx to your password.)

### Using other name than root
It is also possible to register another user name than "root".
In order to use another user name, please add the following to the [mysqld] section
of my.cnf or my.ini.
```
loose-transactd_hostcheck_username = yourUserName
```
Replace yourUserName to an actual user name.

Development of applications using Transactd clients
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Refer to the following SDK documents for development of the applications
using Transactd clients.

http://www.bizstation.jp/ja/transactd/client/sdk/doc/

The ($installdir)/source/bzs/example folder has easy sample codes. 
You can actually be built in a build/example folder by project files (Windows)
according to a compiler, or a make_example.sh (LINUX) script. 

In addition, when you compile the 64Bit of the Visual C++ 2010 Express edittion, 
of each project [Options] - [platform toolset] - [configuration properties] - [General]
make changes to the "Windows7.1SDK" from "v100".

In the case of C++ Builder, installation requires the boost supplied with the compiler
in advance. In addition, [Tools] - [Options] - [Environment Options] - [C++ Options]
- [directory and path] - [System Include Path] add the following

 * For 32Bit: $(CG_BOOST_ROOT)
 * For 64Bit: $(CG_64_BOOST_ROOT)

Details of the test program
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The executable file which starts with test_ is a Test program.

Please be sure to run test with only an instance. It will fail if test runs two or
more instances.
If others access to test database during test runs, fail to drop database and can't
release database.
In such a case, reboot a server or run following command in MySQL command line client
to drop a database.
```
mysql>drop database test;
```

If `-- show_progress=yes` is passed, it shows progress like:
 ```
0%   10   20   30   40   50   60   70   80   90   100%
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
************
```

Using `-- host=xxxxx` can specify host.
The test using Japanese database name, table name and field name.
To pass this test, set `character-set-server` as cp932 or utf8 in my.cnf.
```
[mysqld]
character-set-server=utf8
```



Details of the benchmark program
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The benchmark program, there are two types. It is the benchmark of reading 
SQL-like query benchmarks(bench_query_xxx) and CURD basic operations (bench_tdclcpp_xxx).

The bench_tdclcpp_xxx benchmark program, which can be measured by multiple instances
running at the same time by changing the processNumber of command line arguments.
